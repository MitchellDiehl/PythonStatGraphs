# This is the output of two teams’ average fastball velocity compared to the league average.
## As a pitching fan, watching Seattle’s rotation come up to the big leagues has been exciting! Here, you can see they excel at the new-age velocity mindset, and everyone on the squad can throw gas.

## While still an excellent rotation, Clevelands pitching prowess is much less concise and simple here. While capable of good velocity in general, the cutter/cut fastball philosophy of the organization right now shows 2 sections of velocity in graphing. Skewing their averages, most prominent here is Tanner Bibee at just 91mph. despite this average, Tanner regularly reaches up to 95 and 96 mph, showing a strong skew to below average velocity based on movement based pitches.
