# This is the output of 2 teams average fastball velocity vs the league average.
## As a pitching fan, watching Seattles rotation come up to the big leagues has been exciting! here you can see they excel at new age velocity mindsets and everyone on the squad can throw above league average.

## While still an excellent rotation, Clevelands pitching prowess is much less concise and simple here. while capable of good velocity in general by the gaurdians staff, the cutter/cut fastball philosophy of the organization right now shows 2 sections of velocity in graphing, skewing their averages. Most prominent here is Tanner Bibee at just 91mph. despite this, Tanner regularly reaches up to 95 and 96 mph, showing a strong skew to below average on movement based pitches.
