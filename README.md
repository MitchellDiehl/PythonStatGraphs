# This is the output of two teams’ average fastball velocity compared to the league average.
## As a pitching fan, watching Seattle’s rotation come up to the big leagues has been exciting! Here, you can see they excel at the new-age velocity mindset, and everyone on the squad can throw gas.

## While still an excellent rotation, Clevelands pitching prowess is much less concise and simple here. While capable of good velocity in general, the cutter/cut fastball philosophy of the organization right now shows 2 sections of velocity in graphing. Skewing their averages, most prominent here is Tanner Bibee at just 91mph. despite this average, Tanner regularly reaches up to 95 and 96 mph, showing a strong skew to below average velocity based on movement based pitches.

## Playing around i found Boston is pretty high on cutter usage even more so than Cleveland

You can see with an added ERA statistic for fastballs, just how effective the starters are being with their fastball. Verifed with the helpful site of statmuse, you can see outlier performances during this month like Early's great september! Early didnt give up a single Eearned run with his fastball that month. Lucas Giolito's fastball lagged behind for him at a 7.00 ERA despite an otherwise fine month. Additionally the dominant Max Fried pitched to the tune of a 1.61 ERA, meaning his fastball vastly underperformed compared to his curveball, where hitters may be waiting for a fastball. Then theres the two Crochet and Bello putting up similar overall months to their fastball era which notably comes from using different speed fastballs as their offspeed, meaning we captured a more wholistic view of the players overall performance...
